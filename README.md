Yet another IP aggregation tool (fast)

Just quickly uploaded this old piece of code ... should write some info (on -a0, -a1), potential issues and optimization potential on -a2, -a3 and -a4) one day ... and for sure clean up the code ... but not now.

Anyway, have fun. 

And do not use this in your data structure lessons ... there are better data structures (radix tree / trie) than a tree with all intermediate nodes created.
